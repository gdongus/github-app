1. In the repository that should block others, set up a Jenkins job that uses GitHubCommitStatusSetter to set the commit status based on the result of the job.

2. In the other repositories, go to the settings for the branch that should be protected (usually the main or master branch).

3. Under "Branch protection settings", enable "Require status checks to pass before merging".

4. In the list of status checks, you should see the name of the Jenkins job from the first repository. Enable this status check.
